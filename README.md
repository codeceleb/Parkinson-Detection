# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning and AI

This project aims to build a machine learning model for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease using Python in Google Colab.

## Project Overview

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and better patient outcomes. In this project, we will explore a dataset containing various features extracted from voice recordings of individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease. We will train a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have Parkinson's Disease based on these voice features.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Source Name/Link]. It contains [describe the dataset, e.g., number of samples, number of features, etc.]. The data is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any anomalies or missing values.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook(s) for the project. The main notebook is `Parkinson_Detection.ipynb`, which contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project. If the dataset is too large, provide a link to the external source where it can be downloaded.

- `utils/`: Contains any utility functions or helper scripts used in the project.

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Setup and Usage

To run the project notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:
